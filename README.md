 - Lowry Williams: Wrote the comments and explanations throughout the code and collaborated with the program's configuration live.
 - Finley Grant Jarvis: Wrote out code for the group for game.py and player.py and joined group's configuration live.
 - Emmett Hart: Led debugging and consolidating classes. Wrote several new functions for classes to ensure attributes were kept to one class each. Worked with configuration live.
